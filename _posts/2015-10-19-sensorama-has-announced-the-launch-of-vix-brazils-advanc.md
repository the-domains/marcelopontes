sensorama has announced the launch of 'VIX', brazil's advanced immersive attraction. it's a 24 person ride that straps passengers on a sensory experience of an underwater voyage. as the ride accelerates through a narrow passage of land, guests will feel their hair blowing in the wind, simulating the sensation of levitating through air, fragrances are filtered into the space as guests journey through the forbidden forest, while hints of mist are emitted once the ride plunges towards the deep ocean. the simulation experience which is designed for families and thrill-seekers alike and suitable for ages four and older allows passengers to travel to an underwater cave located thousands of feet below ground.  the hallway before entering the ride         the innovation behind the project, which took two years to complete, lies in the infrastructure, unique user experience and 'VIX's' advanced simulation technology. the project required 100 tons of steel, three kilometers of cabling, a team of more than 90 professionals, a custom-engineered building and a 172 square meter compound curved screen, which is equivalent to the size of an imax theater. 'VIX' delivers cinematic content by using multiple 4K ultra high-resolution projectors, which give an uncompromising image, brightness, and resolution. the combination of six million pixels, uncompressed video, an 18.3 3D audio system, immersive special effects and synchronized movements with six axis motion of freedom, provides guests with a vivid and immersive experience in flying, gliding and speeding through landscapes. the 'VIX' experience will open in october in vila velha, brazil at praia da costa shopping mall.   video courtesy of sensorama   the spaceship's set design   the seating and ride design   the view from the audience perspective   video courtesy of sensorama the ride's infrastructure the curved screen the six different motion arms  the mechanics underneath the seating area
